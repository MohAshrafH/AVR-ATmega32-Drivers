 * Description:
 *     Configuration header file for the Seven Segment Display (SEV_SEG) module for AVR ATmega32 microcontrollers.
 *     This file is intended to define configuration settings for the SEV_SEG module.
 *     It allows the user to customize aspects of the 7-segment display, such as pin connections and display properties.
 *     However, in its current form, it does not contain configurable settings, but is prepared for future scalability.

/* Configuration settings for the SEV_SEG module can be added here.
 * Possible configurations may include:
 * - Custom pin assignments for the BCD data and common control pins.
 * - Configuration for different display types (common cathode or common anode).
 * - Customizable multiplexing delay or brightness settings.
 * - Support for additional hardware features or enhancements.
 */

/* Example of a potential configuration macro:
 * #define SEV_SEG_DISPLAY_TYPE  SEV_SEG_COMMON_CATHODE
 * Where 'SEV_SEG_COMMON_CATHODE' is a defined macro to specify the display type.
